# PLAYDATE

PLAYDATE was a performance that took place across a large area of downtown Brooklyn where audiences could watch performers run errands and interact with the world from ISSUE Project Room.

This project aims to immortalize this experience through the web, giving a new audience an interface and a guided experience through the performance.

To run, host a local web server. One easy way to do this on Macs is to run this in the git directory:  
`python2 -m SimpleHTTPServer .`

This app is currently hosted at: http://elastic-ride-459b16.netlify.app
